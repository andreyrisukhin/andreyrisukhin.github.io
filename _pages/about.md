<!-- I am a Ph.D. Student at the [Department of Computer Science of the University of Illinois](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) at [Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/). -->

I recieved my combined B.S. and M.S. from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I spent time at Contextual AI as an intern.

My research broadly spans **natural language processing** and **machine learning**. My current interests primarily include:
* Implicit goal inference from behavior cues
* User adaptation of text interfaces
